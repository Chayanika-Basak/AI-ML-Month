Final Conclusion: 
1. Honey in the US is gradually becoming rare and expensive as per the data from 1998-2012. 
2. The number of bee colonies hasn't changed a lot, but the yield per colony has reduced.
3. This has resulted in reduced production which in turn has led to a steeply increasing price per pound of honey.
4. The high prices has also resulted in declining demand.
5. Measures have to be taken so that the quality and quantity of honey can be restored by finding out the potential causes of this declining yield.
